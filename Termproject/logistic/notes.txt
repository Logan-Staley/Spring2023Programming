/// OK so i got the CSV file to be inputed in to Linked list X with Bias inputed
/// long with the correct values to each one

// now just get the logistic regression to start and provide accurate
// eastimations on another heart failure to happen

// look into the python graphing like in the previous assignments to get graphs
// of the perceptron and linear regression predictions of people having heart
// failure again

// look at micheals github for examples.

// To use linear regression for predicting potential for another heart failure,
// you could follow these steps:

// Define the problem: The problem is to predict the potential for another heart
// failure based on ejection fraction, serum creatinine, and serum sodium
// levels.

// Gather data: Collect a dataset of patients who have previously experienced
// heart failure, with their ejection fraction, serum creatinine, serum sodium
// levels, and whether or not they had another heart failure.

// Split the data: Split the dataset into a training set and a test set, with a
// ratio of 70:30 or 80:20. The training set will be used to train the linear
// regression model, and the test set will be used to evaluate its performance.

// Prepare the data: Normalize the data using z-score normalization to ensure
// that each feature has a similar range of values. Also, handle any missing or
// erroneous data points by either removing them or imputing them with a
// suitable value.

// Train the model: Use the training set to train a linear regression model that
// predicts the potential for another heart failure based on ejection fraction,
// serum creatinine, and serum sodium levels. The model should learn the weights
// of the features that best predict the output.

// Evaluate the model: Use the test set to evaluate the performance of the
// model. Calculate the root mean squared error (RMSE) to measure the difference
// between the predicted and actual values. You could also use other evaluation
// metrics such as R-squared.

// Make predictions: Once the model has been trained and evaluated, use it to
// make predictions on new data.
